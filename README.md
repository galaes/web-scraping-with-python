# Web Scraping With Python

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is building web scraping tool that automates the process of collecting product information from Amazon such as name, price, and customer reviews. The scraped data will provide insights into market trends, pricing fluctuations, and product popularity over time.

## Scope of Work

- Target Website: Amazon (Product pages)
- Key Data Points to Scrape:
  - Product name
  - Product price
  - Product Rating (stars)
  - Number of customer reviews
- Technologies and Tools:
  - Python
  - BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
  - Requests for sending HTTP requests
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - CSV for data storage

## Implementation Steps

- Inspect Web Page Structre: Analyze the HTML structure of the Amazon product page to locate relevant data points.

- Develop Scraper: Write Python scripts using BeautifulSoup and Requests to fetch and parse product information.
```python
#import libraries
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import time
import datetime
import smtplib
import pandas as pd

```

- Handle Dynamic Content: If necessary, integrate Selenium to handle JavaScript-generated content or CAPTCHA.
- Data Storage: Store the scraped data in a CSV file or SQL database.
- Error Handling and Optimization: Implement mechanisms to handle potential errors (e.g., missing data, changes in HTML structure) and optimize performance (e.g., managing request rate to avoid blocking).
- Automated Scraping (Optional): Set up a scheduling system (e.g., cron jobs) to periodically scrape data and monitor changes.
- Data Analysis (Optional): Perform basic analysis on the scraped data, such as finding average prices, comparing different products, or tracking pricing trends over time.

## Challenges

- Amazon's anti-scraping measures such as CAPTCHA and IP blocking.
- Changes to HTML structure, which may break the scraping script.
- Legal and ethical considerations of scraping data from websites that prohibit it in their terms of service.

## Deliverables:
- Python scripts for web scraping.
- A structured dataset (CSV) containing the scraped product data.

## Future Enhancements:
- Expand the scraper to cover additional categories or other e-commerce platforms (e.g., eBay, Walmart).
- Implement data visualization using tools like Tableau or Matplotlib.
- Build a dashboard to display real-time scraped data and analysis results.
